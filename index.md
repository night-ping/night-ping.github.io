Hi! I'm Youssef Bahgat, but you can call me **Bagota**, **NightPing**, or just **Youssef**.  

I'm a Computer Science student, and this is my personal space to share what I'm learning, my projects, and anything else I find interesting. Here, I like to explore new ideas, write about programming, and reflect on my journey of learning and growth.  

Welcome, and feel free to browse, learn, or even reach out!
